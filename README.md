# Zeppelin Extension for Visual Studio Code

A [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) extension that provides basic notebook support for language kernels that are supported in [Zeppelin Notebooks](https://zeppelin.apache.org/) today. This is _**NOT a Zeppelin Server or language kernel**_--you must have an Zeppelin Server on-the-fly and at least one interpreter configured properly.

## Features
* Basic Zeppelin notebook file rendered in VSCode notebook.
* Paragraph runnable in notebook, and result is shown in cell output, provided Zeppelin server URL (and login credential).

## Contribution
__The extension is currently under personal development. If you would like to develop with me, please fire an issue.__
