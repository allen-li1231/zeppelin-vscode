# Zeppelin Extension for Visual Studio Code

A [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) extension that provides basic notebook support for language kernels that are supported in [Zeppelin Notebooks](https://zeppelin.apache.org/) today. This is _**NOT a Zeppelin Server or language kernel**_--you must have an Zeppelin Server on-the-fly and at least one interpreter configured properly.

## Features
### The extension is currently under development, if you would like to develop with me, please fire an issue or create discussion.
